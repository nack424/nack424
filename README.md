# Hello! Nack's here
I'm currently junior student studying in science bachelor at Chiang Mai university, Thailand📖. I'm comfortable when working with deep learning model in image processing and computer vision👁‍🗨. I'm passionate about learning more machine translation, frontend developing, and developer tools❤️‍🔥. When I'm exhausted from working, I often play visual novel games and sometime play rythm game like Arcaea and Cytus II in my iPad🎮.
